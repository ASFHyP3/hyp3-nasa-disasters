# Configuration Population Directory
This directory contains the scripts and templates for generating MDCS configuration files 
that use a set list of source rasters rather than using a filter to select everything in
a source S3 bucket.

The populate_xml_with_data.py file requires a Python environment no lower than 3.9, 
while most of the rest of this repo is tied to an ArcGIS Pro installation of Python (currently 3.7).
This script was generated by Esri professional services under contract with NASA Disasters. 
All other directory content was generated by ASF.

The outputs from the scripts in this directory are generally destined for the 
image_server\asf_services\Parameter\Config directory.
